# Mr Flappy Bird (hold-to-fly)

Simple single-page web game. Hold the Space bar (or ArrowUp) or press-and-hold the screen to make the bird fly upward. Release and the bird falls. Avoid the spiky pipes.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main SPA entry
- `style.css` — styles and responsive layout
- `app.js` — game logic and input handling

How to run:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (works by file:// for many browsers).

Or run a simple local server (recommended) from the project root:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Controls:

- Hold Space / ArrowUp to fly
- Hold on the screen (mobile) — use the on-screen `Hold` button if visible

Enjoy! If you want sounds, high-score persistence or a build step, tell me which feature to add next.
